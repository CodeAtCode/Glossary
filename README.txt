= Could I use more than a term title pointing to the same term page? =

Yes, you are able to use how many term titles you want using the "Related search terms" field into your WordPress Glossary Editor Page. In this way you'll be able to auto-link more than one term to the same page (E.g. Call To Action, CTA, Action Button)

= Could I use your auto-link engine for affiliation purposes? =

Yes, and we encourage you to do it.
