# Warning
*This repo is outdated*, please if you are looking for the last version of “Glossary by codeat” WordPress plugin simply download it from the official WordPress.org directory.  
[https://wordpress.org/plugins/glossary-by-codeat/](https://wordpress.org/plugins/glossary-by-codeat/).

We recently moved to a freemium model for this plugin so now there are two versions of this code, one is for free and still has all the old features plus some newer that we introduced for free during the last months. We decided to dismiss this github repository in order to focus more on the maintaining of the public free version on wp.org and on the private (still open source and GPL) on our servers. 

We are happy if you want to contribute to the project and we encourage you to do this by keep in contact with us using official channels like the support forum on wordpress and through our support system included in the Professional version.

Thank you from the codeat team.
 
## Composer
We love composer and to continue to get updates you can use [https://wpackagist.org/](https://wpackagist.org/) using `wpackagist-plugin/glossary-by-codeat`
